### Function Exercises

#### Assignment: Do exercises found in each of the exercises.js and the arrays.js files

- Notes
  - Had some minor difficulty with the rovarspraket exercise in excercises-2, finally realized I needed to splice the new stuff at i+1 (right after the current letter). Lots of fun mental positioning questions
  - took me awhile to realize I needed to use .join to concatinate everything into a string but .concat to put two arrays together. This is not good semantic naming.
  - threw me off that 'instructors' was an array of objects, not an actual object itself, but I rewrote the function to fit that pretty quick once I realized that was what the issue was.
